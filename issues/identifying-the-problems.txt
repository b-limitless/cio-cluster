1.Well one issue with this system is something rabbit mq does no fire any event
2. When I do update my code in termal I should see all console that I have in index.ts file
3. In the entry file i have lets say connect to the server, connected with mongodb and rabbitMQ as well
4. All of those somethimes does not work, I am not certainly sure about in which condition its not working 
5. Is that rabbitMQ is the issue, If it was then at least the console which I have in entry file
6. Which state that listening to port 3000 and its not printing at all to the terminal sometimes
7. Til this point of time I an unable to identify
8. In the term of data replication in different services I had logged in to my pods and check in many 
10 Condition data are replicated when event is fired but when there is nothing in console then there is no daevent is fired


Suspect issues
1. I am suspecting this issue perpahs in kubernetes cluster when its use the docker container 
and installed all dependencies to each codebase it use the dev version of typescript 
rather it should build he codebase and script show start the server from build index.js file 
not from the index.ts entry file

2. I am still thinking about this at least at this point of time I am assure that there is something 
is wrong
