1 When adding febric it should not re fetch the febric again from the server
the way UI is presented made it complicated to deal with the this situation 

in this case listing febric and adding febric should be in same route in this case I can simply 
start adding the febric and when its done then push the added febric to refix store 
rather then re fetching

But as history.push automatially reload the component when the route is changes 
therefore useEffect runs when component is mounted
